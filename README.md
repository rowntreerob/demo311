# demo311
 roboflow AI for classifying photos by type in an app context uploading media containing all the metadata needed to define org311 issues like graffiti or garbage. Organized for easy **learn to code** experience using an interactive notebook format, this project also presents  a lightweight webapp front end, simple html providing photo uploads, parsing metadata out of the photo and classifying photos according to issue-type. When combined, these prototype features allow point-and-shoot pothole reporting - a complete capture of a org311 type issue takes place while reporting the issue is as simple as take a picture and submit it.
